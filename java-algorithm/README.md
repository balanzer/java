# Java Algorithm

## Bubble Sort 

* Pick a item, compare the item with all items in the list and swap if the compared item is smaller than the original item.
* at the end of one iteration on the list - largest item will be on the last  
* redo step 1 & 2 & skip the item index which already sorted. 

## Selection sort 

* Start with index 0 - large item index
* Compare the data at large item index with next index, if large them record that index as large item index
* After loop end - saw last item data with data at large item index - now this position is sorted. 
* redo step 1 - 3 & skip the item index which already sorted.
